# CS2-Clean-and-functional-autoexec
Clean and uncluttered autoexec ready for competitive use. 
I will keep the autoexec updated by adding new useful commands and removing deprecated or useless one's.

Place the file named autoexec.cfg into yout Cs2 folder, the usual path is: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg"
Once in game open the console and write: "exec autoexec"; have fun
